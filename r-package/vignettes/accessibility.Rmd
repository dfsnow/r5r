# 1. Introduction 

Accessibility indicators measure the ease with which opportunities, such as jobs,
can be reached by a traveler from a particular location [@levinson2020manual]. One
of the simplest forms of accessibility metrics is the cumulative-opportunities, 
which counts all of the opportunities accessible from each location in less than a 
cutoff time. Using a travel time matrix and information on the number of opportunities available at each location, we can calculate and map accessibility. This vignette shows how to do that in R using the [`r5r` package](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/index.html).

In this reproducible example, we will be using a sample data set for the city of 
Porto Alegre (Brazil) included in `r5r`. We can compute accessibility in 5 quick 
steps:

1. Increase Java memory and load libraries
2. Build routable transport network
3. Calculate Accessibility
4. Map Accessibility



# 2. Build routable transport network with `setup_r5()`

### Increase Java memory and load libraries

Before we start, we need to increase the memory available to Java and load the 
packages used in this vignette

```{r, message = FALSE}
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx2G")

library(r5r)
library(sf)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(interp)
library(dplyr)
```

To build a routable transport network with r5r and load it into memory, the user 
needs to call `setup_r5` with the path to the directory where OpenStreetMap and 
GTFS data are stored.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# system.file returns the directory with example data inside the r5r package
# set data path to directory containing your own data if not using the examples
data_path <- system.file("extdata/poa", package = "r5r")

r5r_core <- setup_r5(data_path)
```


# 3. Calculate Accessibility

In this example, we will be calculating the number of schools and public healthcare facilities accessible by public transport within a travel time of up to 20 minutes. The sample data provided contains information on the spatial distribution of schools in Porto Alegre in the `points$schools` column, and healthcare facilities in the `points$healthcare` column. 

With the code below we compute the number of schools and healthcare accessible considering median of multiple travel time estimates departing every minute over a 60-minute time window, between 2pm and 3pm. The `accessibility()` function can calculate access to multiple opportunities in a single call, which is much more efficient and convenient than producing a travel time matrix of the study area and manually computing accessibility.


```{r, message = FALSE}
# read all points in the city
points <- fread(file.path(data_path, "poa_hexgrid.csv"))

# routing inputs
mode <- c("WALK", "TRANSIT")
max_walk_time <- 30 # in minutes
travel_time_cutoff <- 21 # in minutes
departure_datetime <- as.POSIXct("13-05-2019 14:00:00",
                                 format = "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S")

time_window <- 60 # in minutes
percentiles <- 50

# calculate travel time matrix
access <- accessibility(r5r_core,
                        origins = points,
                        destinations = points,
                        mode = mode,
                        opportunities_colnames = c("schools", "healthcare"),
                        decay_function = "step",
                        cutoffs = travel_time_cutoff,
                        departure_datetime = departure_datetime,
                        max_walk_time = max_walk_time,
                        time_window = time_window,
                        percentiles = percentiles,
                        progress = FALSE)


head(access)
```





# 4. Map Accessibility

The final step is mapping the accessibility results calculated earlier. The code
below demonstrates how to do that, with some extra steps to produce a prettier map by doing a spatial interpolation of accessibility estimates.

```{r, message = FALSE, out.width='100%'}
# interpolate estimates to get spatially smooth result
access_schools <- access %>% 
  filter(opportunity == "schools") %>%
  inner_join(points, by='id') %>%
  with(interp::interp(lon, lat, accessibility)) %>%
  with(cbind(acc=as.vector(z),  # Column-major order
             x=rep(x, times=length(y)),
             y=rep(y, each=length(x)))) %>% as.data.frame() %>% na.omit() %>%
  mutate(opportunity = "schools")

access_health <- access %>% 
  filter(opportunity == "healthcare") %>%
  inner_join(points, by='id') %>%
  with(interp::interp(lon, lat, accessibility)) %>%
  with(cbind(acc=as.vector(z),  # Column-major order
             x=rep(x, times=length(y)),
             y=rep(y, each=length(x)))) %>% as.data.frame() %>% na.omit() %>%
  mutate(opportunity = "healthcare")

access.interp <- rbind(access_schools, access_health)

# find results' bounding box to crop the map
bb_x <- c(min(access.interp$x), max(access.interp$x))
bb_y <- c(min(access.interp$y), max(access.interp$y))

# extract OSM network, to plot over map
street_net <- street_network_to_sf(r5r_core)

# plot
ggplot(na.omit(access.interp)) +
  geom_sf(data = street_net$edges, color = "gray55", size=0.01, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_contour_filled(aes(x=x, y=y, z=acc), alpha=.7) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = -1, option = 'B') +
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  coord_sf(xlim = bb_x, ylim = bb_y, datum = NA) + 
  labs(fill = "Facilities within\n20 minutes\n(median travel time)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~opportunity)
```


### Cleaning up after usage

`r5r` objects are still allocated to any amount of memory previously set after they are done with their calculations. In order to remove an existing `r5r` object and reallocate the memory it had been using, we use the `stop_r5` function followed by a call to Java's garbage collector, as follows:

```{r, message = FALSE}
r5r::stop_r5(r5r_core)
rJava::.jgc(R.gc = TRUE)
```
